# Scheduling algorithms in C

The implementation of famous processes scheduling algorithms (done by the OS to utilize the CPU)

## Getting Started

You will need to compile the source files for whichever algorithms you want to run, then enter the input file through the stdin of the compiled program.
[Compile and run C using gcc (ubuntu)](http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/teaching/CAN_e14/Readings/How%20to%20Compile%20and%20Run%20a%20C%20Program%20on%20Ubuntu%20Linux.pdf)
